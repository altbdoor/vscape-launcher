An alternative launcher for the game, written in [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/).

### Please note that this launcher is not verified and not endorsed by the original developers of /v/scape. This is merely an implementation on my free time. You cannot even use this at your own risk. Its not working until a further step is taken.

#### What is this?
An alternative launcher for the game [/v/scape](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vscape) for Windows.

#### Why? There is already a launcher.
1. The original launcher is written in Java, and expects users to already have Java installed. **Some people don't have Java installed.**
1. The original launcher is downloaded as a zip file (an issue with the file host, I think). The zip file extension had to be removed. **Some people don't know how to edit file extensions.**

#### What does it do?
1. Check if Java is installed. If not, ask the user to install Java.
1. Check for update with a click of a button, instead of every time when it starts.

#### Why AutoHotkey?
One of the easiest languages available on my system to build a GUI.

#### So I need to compile it?
To get an exe file, yes. If you already have AHK, you can launch the script directly.

#### Why doesn't it work? What extra step needs to be taken?
This application should not work. The launcher depends on a Dropbox link from one of the developers. I did not obtain permission from the developers to use the link (its currently [Google](https://www.google.com)).

Until I get the permission to do so, you have to decompile the original launcher file and look for the link. Replace the Google link, and it should work. Bear in mind that this link is maintained by the original developers, not me. Now you can be safely warned to use it at your own risk.

#### Why don't you compile an exe?
Again, this application is not verified and not endorsed by the original developers. Until they do so, no dice from me.
